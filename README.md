### Hi there!
***
My name is Elizabeth and I am a culinary professional and a recent graduate of Flatiron School's Data Science program.  I have spent the past eight years in the hospitality industry using my background in business management to lead various teams.  Working as a chef in fast paced environments has taught me how to problem solve quickly, communicate effectively, and to understand the big picture.

Although I have enjoyed my time as a chef, I am very excited about learning new skills and starting my career in the tech field.  Being a data scientist initially appealed to me because of my interest in mathematics and obsession with organization.  Through Faltiron's program, I discovered a love of Python, SQL, and Natural Language Processing.

My goal is to work for a company that has a strong focus on making a positive difference in the world, whether that be socially or environmentally.

## What I'm up to:

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more about SQL and Tableau
- ðŸ’¬ Open to communication and collaboration on projects that help the community
- ðŸ“« Email me at eaw524@gmail.com 
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: She/Her
- âš¡ Hobbies: Yoga, Home Remodeling, Running, Painting, Cooking
